[mod-setting-description]
quality-processing--no-surface-restriction=Disables crafting surface conditions for upgrade material recipes added by this mod.
quality-processing--no-thruster-surface-restriction=Disables crafting surface conditions for thruster fuel/oxidizer recipes, which are needed for higher level quality upgrades.
quality-processing--no-promethium=Removes promethium as ingredient of legendary upgrades
quality-processing--simple-upgrade-items=Removes intermediate products from crafting upgrade items.
quality-processing--no-upgrade-items=Removes the need for upgrade items and fluid ingredients, making quality upgrades free. Overwrites simple upgrade items.
quality-processing--direct-upgrades=Allows always upgrading to a machine's output quality, even when the input is more than one step lower.
quality-processing--spoil-time-mul=Some upgrade items for higher qualities can spoil by default. A higher value here means more time before the item spoils. Set to 0 to disable spoiling of upgrade items.

quality-processing--cost-pre-scale=To calculate on the ingredient cost for quality upgrades based on an items "complexity". The formula is <final scale> * (<complexity scale> * <complexity>) ^ <exponent>
quality-processing--cost-exp=The exponent in the upgrade ingredient cost. Values lower than 1 give more bias to more complex end products, making their upgrade cost less than that of their ingredients.
quality-processing--cost-scale=A final multiplier on the  upgrade ingredient cost.
quality-processing--upgrade-item-cost-scale=A multiplier on the ingredient cost for upgrading quality upgrade items (post processing kit, calibration matrix, etc.). This is applied on top of the general upgrade cost calculation.

quality-processing--min-time=The minimum time for an upgrade recipe. If upgrading a single item would be faster, a bulk recipe is created. Increase this if the upgrade fails from very fast crafting speeds.
quality-processing--time-scale=A multiplier on the time for quality upgrades.
quality-processing--upgrade-item-time-scale=A multiplier on the time for upgrading quality upgrade items (post processing kit, calibration matrix, etc.). This is applied on top of the general upgrade cost calculation.

quality-processing--log-complexity=Write the complexity values for all resolved items to factorio-current.log.
quality-processing--preset-complexity=Comma separated list of item-name=complexity. E.g. "iron-plate=0.5,nuclear-reactor=1000". This is applied before item complexities are resolved.
quality-processing--unknown-ingredients-complexity=A fallback complexity for items that have no known sources/recipes. 0 to disable, which will not generate upgrade recipes for these items and any that depend on them.
quality-processing--fallback-complexity=A fallback complexity value for all items that could not be resolved. 0 to disable, which will not generate upgrade recipes for unresolved items.

quality-processing--hide-quality-modules=Hides the vanilla quality modules and their recipes.
quality-processing--item-blacklist=Comma separated list of item names that should not be upgradable. E.g. "iron-plate,nuclear-reactor".
